# 💧 Water Potability Analysis

This project aims to predict whether water is safe for drinking based on various chemical features using machine learning models. It helps automate water quality checks and supports public health monitoring systems.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Unsafe drinking water can lead to serious health issues. This project analyzes chemical properties such as pH, sulfate, solids, and chloramines to classify water as potable or not.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Procedure
1. Load the dataset and libraries  
2. Clean missing values  
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Scale and preprocess the data  
5. Split into training and testing sets  
6. Train models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)  
7. Evaluate model performance  
8. Select the best model  
9. (Optional) Deploy using Flask or Streamlit

## ✅ Results
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Accuracy:** ~80%  
- **Key Features:** Sulfate, Solids, pH, Chloramines  

## 📌 Conclusion
The Random Forest model effectively predicts water potability. Challenges like missing data and imbalance were addressed, and the model is ready for integration in real-world systems.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Real-time integration with IoT sensors  
- Cloud deployment (AWS, Azure)  
- Deep learning-based enhancements  
- Mobile/web interface for accessibility
